This dataset contains all WordsEye scenes created between January 1 2013 and September 24 2020. 
The data has been randomly split into approximately 90% training, 10% testing and 10% development data. All scenes created on one day are kept together in one of the splits. This reduces cases in which (near-)identical scenes appear in two different splits.
